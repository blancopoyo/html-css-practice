//  Strict mode is a way of making your JavaScript more secure and strict, basically, you cannot blindly set variables, you must use them with var const let.
//   it helps to quickly identify error. we will put the "use strict" just under the opening script tag.
//      now lets say for example, we did y= "Thing" if we check console it wont work or else we add let y = thing.  but if we remove the use strict the y = "Thing" will work.
// but if we add a let const or var at the back of the variable, it will alwyas work even if we use the strict mode.

// below we could see that we put the use strict, if we go to web console there will be error. 
// the use strict will detect the error. however if we remove the use strict we wont see error.
"use strict"

 y = "things"
 
 let b = "Something"
 console.log(b)
