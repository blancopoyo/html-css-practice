// we created a game using a while loop. we set a number variable that has a prompt that will allow a user to enter random number,
//  that if the random number falls within the number we have set/programmed which is 10, it should show an alert that says YOU WIN. the we added the break to make it stop.
//   if the user didnt guess the random number correctly, it will continue looping by asking them to continue input number.
    //Then we added an else that will tell them the wrong number they initially inputed

while(true) {
    let number = prompt("Guess the number")
    number = Number(number);
    const randomNumber= Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10 )
    if (number === randomNumber) {
     alert("YOU WIN")
     break;
    }
    else { console.log("You guessed", number, "But the right number was", randomNumber)}
