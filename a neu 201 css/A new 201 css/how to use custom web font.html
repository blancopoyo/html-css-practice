    This is a lesson on how to use web customized fonts instead of using the fonts of font-family. You have to go to fonts.google click on a particular font you like go to embed, its either you import through Css or html but lets copy through html. copy the link, go to your code and paste it just above the style. exactly under the title element. make sure you check the family font your customized web fonts falls under, you will see it under the embed section in google web. copy and paste on the style element of the code youre working on. e.g body{ font-family: 'Rubik Gemstones, Cursive;} 
    But we can likewise decide not to use the customize font from the web, we can use direct from the code font options.in Css style section just type font-family: and it will give you font options.
