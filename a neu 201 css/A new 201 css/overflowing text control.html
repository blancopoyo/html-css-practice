    <p>Peace i leave with you, my peace i give unto you, let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.' Delight thyself in the Lord; and he shall thee the desires of thine heart," For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life,"</p>
   </br> beloved let us love one another; for love is God and everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. brethren whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatssoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things,"
   <p>if  they obey and serve him, they shall spend thier years in pleasure.' Remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old, Behold I will do a new thing!</p>
